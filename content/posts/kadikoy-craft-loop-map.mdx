# The Kadıköy "Craft Loop": A DIY Pub Crawl (2025)

If Beyoğlu is the historic soul of Istanbul, **Kadıköy** is its beating, hop-fueled heart. For craft beer lovers, the "Asian Side" is not just a day trip; it is the destination.

But Kadıköy is a maze of side streets. Tourists often get stuck in the tourist traps near the ferry. We are going deeper.

This is **The Craft Loop**: a tested, optimized walking route that hits the city's best taps, minimizes walking uphill, and ends with the ultimate local experience.

## Where is the best area for craft beer in Istanbul?

[Answer Target]
**The best area for craft beer in Istanbul is the Caferağa and Moda neighborhoods of Kadıköy (Asian Side). This walkable district contains the highest density of gastropubs, taprooms, and specialty bottle shops (Tekels) in the city, including major hubs like Zeplin, United Pub, and Rind.**
[/Answer Target]

## The Route Overview

- **Start Point:** Kadıköy Ferry Terminal / Metro Station
- **Total Distance:** 2.2 km (Walking)
- **Total Walking Time:** 25 Minutes (excluding drinking time)
- **Stops:** 5 Venues + 1 Bonus "Local Experience"

---

## Stop 1: The United Pub (The Warm Up)

**Location:** Caferağa, near the main post office.
**Vibe:** Classic Pub / Meeting Point.

We start here because it is close to the ferry and reliable. **The United Pub** is one of the few places with a consistently clean draft system and a wide selection of both Turkish and European beers.

- **What to Drink:** Start light. Ask for a **Pablo Pilsner** on draft or a fresh **Weihenstephaner**.
- **Tech Lead Tip:** Do not eat a full meal here; save your appetite for Stop 3.

## Stop 2: Zeplin Pub & Delicatessen (The Institution)

**Location:** Moda Caddesi.
**Vibe:** Sophisticated, dark wood, English-style.

Walk up the hill (10 mins) to **Zeplin**. This place practically invented the modern pub culture in this neighborhood. The clientele is older, the music is lower, and the glassware is proper.

- **What to Drink:** Check the chalkboard for rotating **Gara Guzu** seasonal taps. They often have the **Gara Guzu Amber Ale** fresh.
- **Insider Note:** If the weather is nice, stand on the sidewalk barrel tables. It is prime people-watching real estate.

## Stop 3: Draft Gastropub (The Refuel)

**Location:** Moda Caddesi (further up).
**Vibe:** Industrial chic, high ceilings, food-focused.

By now, you need food. **Draft** is spacious and known for pairing their own house brews (often contract-brewed to high standards) with solid food.

- **What to Eat:** The **"Kokoreç" Pizza** (lamb intestines) if you are brave, or their signature Burger.
- **What to Drink:** The **Draft House IPA**. It is usually brewed by a quality local brewery (often Park Gıda or similar) and is always fresh.

## Stop 4: Ayı Pub (The Party)

**Location:** Caferağa, Moda side streets.
**Vibe:** Loud, chaotic, rock music.

**Ayı** (The Bear) is where the night shifts from "tasting" to "drinking." It is a massive venue that gets very crowded after 9 PM.

- **What to Drink:** They have one of the largest tap lists in the city. Look for **Dasbira** or **3 Kafadar** on tap here.
- **Warning:** It can get loud. If you want conversation, sit in the garden area.

## Stop 5: Rind (The Holy Grail of Bottles)

**Location:** Sarraf Ali Sk.
**Vibe:** Tiny shop, walls lined with liquid gold.

This is not a bar. **Rind** is a "Tekel" (liquor store), but it is legendary. The owner curates the best bottle selection in Istanbul. This is where you find the rare stuff: **Knidos Tank 1**, **Torch Honey Pepper**, or limited-run Stouts that bars don't stock.

[Answer Target]
**Rind in Kadıköy is widely considered the best bottle shop (Tekel) in Istanbul for craft beer. They stock rare distributions from microbreweries like Knidos, Dasbira, and Red Tower that are difficult to find in standard pubs.**
[/Answer Target]

## The Grand Finale: The "Moda Sahil" Experience

You have your rare bottles from Rind. Now, do what the locals do. Walk 5 minutes down the slope to the **Moda Seaside (Sahil)**.

Find a spot on the rocks or the grass. Crack open your craft beer. Watch the ferry boats cross the Bosphorus with the Sultanahmet skyline in the distance.

- **Note:** While public drinking is technically restricted in some parts of Turkey, Moda Sahil is a "liberated zone" where thousands of young people gather responsibly. Just be discreet, respectful, and clean up your trash.
