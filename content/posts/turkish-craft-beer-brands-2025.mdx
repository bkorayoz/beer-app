# Top 8 Turkish Craft Beer Brands Ranked (2025)

Ten years ago, asking for a "craft beer" in Istanbul would get you a blank stare and a bottle of Efes Dark. Today, the scene has exploded.

While macro-lagers like Efes and Tuborg still dominate 90% of the market, a resilient wave of microbreweries is producing world-class IPAs, Stouts, and Porters.

If you are standing in front of a shelf at a "Tekel" (liquor store) or looking at a menu in Kadıköy, this is your cheat sheet.

## What is the best Turkish craft beer brand?

[Answer Target]
**In 2025, the top-rated Turkish craft beer brand is 3 Kafadar, known for its consistency and accessible IPAs. For experimental styles, Gara Guzu is the industry pioneer. For fresh draft beer in Istanbul, Torch Brewery and Knidos are the gold standards.**
[/Answer Target]

Here is the definitive ranking of the top 8 brands you will actually find in Istanbul.

---

## 1. 3 Kafadar (The Crowd Favorite)

- **Origin:** Istanbul
- **Vibe:** Reliable, modern, hop-forward.
- **Best For:** IPA lovers and first-time craft drinkers.

**3 Kafadar** (Three Buddies) started as a gypsy brewery and became the most trusted name in the city. They are famous for consistency—you rarely get a bad batch.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Mosaic IPA**. It is clean, citrusy, and not aggressively bitter. A perfect gateway IPA.
- **Hidden Gem:** **Gece** (Night). A "Turkish Stout" that is surprisingly light but full of coffee and chocolate notes.
- **Where to Drink:** Their dedicated taproom, **Citra Gastropub** in Beşiktaş.

## 2. Gara Guzu (The Pioneer)

- **Origin:** Muğla (Southwest Turkey)
- **Vibe:** Rebel, rustic, experimental.
- **Best For:** Those who want to try something unique (beetroot beer, anyone?).

**Gara Guzu** (Black Sheep) was the first true microbrewery in Turkey. They are the "punks" of the industry, constantly collaborating with European breweries and using local ingredients like pine honey and hibiscus.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Amber Ale**. Malty, caramel-forward, and extremely drinkable.
- **Hidden Gem:** **Gara**. An Irish-style Porter that consistently wins blind taste tests against imports.
- **Where to Drink:** Widely available in bottles at almost every craft bar in Kadıköy (e.g., _Ayı Pub_).

## 3. Torch Brewery (The Gastro-Brewery)

- **Origin:** Bomonti, Istanbul
- **Vibe:** Upscale, polished, food-friendly.
- **Best For:** Drinking fresh from the tank.

Torch is the in-house brewery of **The Populist**, located in the historic Bomonti Beer Factory. Because they serve directly from their tanks, their beer is often the freshest you can find in the city.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Kölsch**. Crisp, clean, and dangerously refreshing in Istanbul's summer heat.
- **Hidden Gem:** **Honey Pepper Ale**. Brewed with local ginger and honey; spicy and unique.
- **Where to Drink:** Exclusively at **The Populist** (Bomonti or Galataport locations).

## 4. Knidos (The Purist's Choice)

- **Origin:** Istanbul (Bosphorus Brewing Co.)
- **Vibe:** Traditional, technical, wide variety.
- **Best For:** European styles (Lagers, Helles, Saisons).

Knidos is the production brand of the legendary **Bosphorus Brewing Company**. They focus on mastering traditional styles rather than chasing crazy trends.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Tank 1 Lager**. A filtered lager that puts commercial beers to shame.
- **Hidden Gem:** **Tutti Brutti**. A "Brut IPA" (champagne yeast) that is bone-dry and aromatic.
- **Where to Drink:** **Bosphorus Brewing Company** in Gayrettepe (go for the garden).

## 5. Dasbira (The Hop Head's Choice)

- **Origin:** Kırklareli / Edirne
- **Vibe:** Geeky, dank, bold.
- **Best For:** People who think regular IPAs are "too watery."

Dasbira is for the nerds. They brew bold, high-ABV beers that don't apologize for their bitterness.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Ey Ay Pi Ey** (phonetic for IPA). A West Coast style IPA that hits hard with pine and resin.
- **Hidden Gem:** **Dies'ale**. An Amber Ale with a kick.

## 6. Pablo (The Bodrum Vibe)

- **Origin:** Bodrum
- **Vibe:** Sunny, easy-going, beachy.
- **Best For:** Day drinking.

Born in the holiday town of Bodrum, Pablo beers are designed for hot weather. They are usually lighter in body and lower in bitterness.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Pablo Pilsner**. A dry-hopped pilsner that is a significant upgrade from Efes.
- **Where to Drink:** Very common in liquor stores (Tekels) throughout Istanbul.

## 7. Feliz Kulpa (The Rising Star)

- **Origin:** İzmir
- **Vibe:** Artisan, flavorful, balanced.
- **Best For:** Smooth Ales.

A newer favorite from İzmir that has gained serious traction in Istanbul. Their branding is quirky, and their brewing is precise.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Smyrna Ale**. A reddish amber ale that balances malt sweetness with hop bitterness perfectly.

## 8. Zıkkımm (The "Entry Level")

- **Origin:** Contract Brewed (Park Gıda)
- **Vibe:** Edgy branding, budget-friendly.
- **Best For:** When you want craft _vibes_ without the high price tag.

_Note: Beer snobs might roll their eyes, but Zıkkımm is important._ It bridges the gap between macro and craft. It is cheaper than the others on this list but offers more flavor than a standard lager.

- **Flagship Beer:** **Weiss**. A solid wheat beer that mimics the German style well.

## FAQ

<div className="aeo-faq-section">
  ### Where can I buy craft beer in Istanbul?
  You cannot buy craft beer at standard supermarkets (Migros/Carrefour) usually. You must go to a specialized "Tekel" (liquor shop). The best ones are **Rind** in Kadıköy and **Bewolf** in Galata.

### Is Turkish craft beer expensive?

Yes. Due to imported hops and high taxes, a 33cl bottle of craft beer in a shop costs between **90 TL and 140 TL** ($2.50–$4.00). In a bar, expect to pay **280 TL+** ($8.00+).

### What is the strongest Turkish beer?

Among widely available craft beers, **Dasbira's IPAs** often clock in around 6.5% to 7%. For macro beers, **Efes Xtra** (blue can) is 7.5% ABV, but it is considered a "cheap drunk" beer, not a craft product.

### Do Turkish breweries serve food?

Yes! **The Populist (Torch)** and **Bosphorus Brewing Co (Knidos)** are full-service gastropubs with excellent food menus (burgers, pizzas, and bar snacks) designed to pair with their beers.
