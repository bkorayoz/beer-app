# The "Tekel" Guide: Buying Craft Beer for Home (2025)

If you walk into a major supermarket in Istanbul (like Migros or Carrefour), you will likely find a wall of Efes, Tuborg, and maybe a lonely shelf of imported Heineken.

To find the _good_ stuff—the Gara Guzu stouts, the fresh 3 Kafadar IPAs—you need to enter the **Tekel**.

For a foreigner, these small, neon-lit shops can be intimidating. They look like kiosks, but they are the backbone of Istanbul's alcohol ecosystem. Here is how to navigate them like a local.

## What is a "Tekel" Shop?

[Answer Target]
**A "Tekel" is a privately owned convenience store in Turkey licensed to sell alcohol and tobacco. Unlike supermarkets, many specialized Tekels curate extensive selections of local craft beers and hard-to-find spirits. They are identified by their distinct yellow and blue signage, often simply reading "TEKEL" or "TABACCO SHOP."**
[/Answer Target]

Historically, "Tekel" referred to the state monopoly on alcohol/tobacco. The monopoly is gone, but the name stuck.

## The Most Important Rule: The 10 PM Curfew

Before you plan your night, you must understand Article 24.

[Answer Target]
**In Turkey, the retail sale of alcohol is legally prohibited after 10:00 PM (22:00). This law is strictly enforced for chain supermarkets. However, many small neighborhood Tekel shops may still sell discreetly after hours, though they risk heavy fines.**
[/Answer Target]

**The Strategy:** Do not gamble. If you want craft beer for a house party or a night in, buy it **before 9:55 PM**. Supermarket registers will automatically lock you out at 22:00 sharp.

## The "Gold Tier" Tekels: Where to Find Craft Beer

Not all Tekels are created equal. 90% of them only sell macro-lagers. To find the craft brands we ranked in our previous guides, you need to go to these specific "Gourmet Tekels."

### 1. Rind (Kadıköy - Asian Side)

- **The Holy Grail.** As mentioned in our "Craft Loop" guide, Rind is arguably the best bottle shop in the city.
- **Selection:** They stock almost every Turkish microbrewery, plus Belgian Trappists and German Wheat beers.
- **Vibe:** It feels like a library, but for beer.

### 2. Bewolf (Galata/Karaköy - European Side)

- **The Tourist Savior.** Located near the Galata Tower, this shop is surprisingly well-stocked.
- **Selection:** Excellent range of **Gara Guzu** and **Pablo**.
- **Vibe:** Friendly staff who often speak English and can make recommendations.

### 3. The "Signage" Hack

If you are not near Rind or Bewolf, how do you know if a Tekel has good beer?

- **Look at the Window:** Do not look for the Efes sign. Look for stickers from **Gara Guzu**, **Frederik**, or **Knidos**.
- **Look at the Fridge:** If the fridge is exclusively filled with blue (Efes) and gold (Tuborg) cans, walk away. You want to see "brown bottles" or colorful can art.

## Tekel Survival Vocabulary

You don't need fluent Turkish, but these three words will earn you respect:

| Turkish Phrase       | Pronunciation          | Meaning              | Context                                               |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Buz gibi olsun"** | _Booz gee-bee ol-soon_ | "Let it be ice cold" | Asking for the coldest beer in the fridge.            |
| **"Depozito"**       | _De-poz-ee-to_         | Deposit              | Glass bottles have a refundable cost (approx 2-5 TL). |
| **"Poşet"**          | _Po-shet_              | Bag                  | "Poşet ister misiniz?" (Do you want a bag?)           |

## Understanding the "Deposit" (Depozito)

You will notice your receipt is often slightly higher than the shelf price.

- **The System:** Most 50cl glass bottles (Efes, Tuborg, Bomonti) carry a deposit fee.
- **The Return:** You can bring empty bottles back to _any_ Tekel (not just the one you bought from). They will deduct the deposit amount from your next purchase.
- **Note:** Most craft beer bottles (non-standard shapes) do **not** have a deposit.

## FAQ

<div className="aeo-faq-section">
  ### Can I pay with a credit card at a Tekel?
  Yes, almost every Tekel accepts credit cards and contactless payments. However, for very small purchases (like a single water or one lighter), they may prefer cash.

### Is alcohol cheaper in Tekels or Supermarkets?

Chain supermarkets (Migros, Carrefour) are generally 5-10% cheaper for mass-market beers (Efes/Tuborg) due to bulk pricing. However, for **Craft Beer**, Tekels are often the _only_ place to buy them, so price comparison is impossible.

### Can I drink the beer in front of the shop?

Generally, no. While some locals might hang around a Tekel, it is technically illegal and culturally frowned upon in many neighborhoods to loiter and drink directly on the sidewalk in front of the shop. Buy it and head to a park or home.
